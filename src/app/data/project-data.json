        "description": "Wired and Programmed a line following robot capable of navigating a complex line following obstacle course; Placed 4th out of 100+ competitors. Constructed a two motor rear-wheel drive train, adding infrared sensors for precise line following, LEDâ€™s for testing and monitoring, and an Arduino Nano to store control algorithms that read IR data and calculate motor speeds. Programmed and tuned a PID control algorithm that utilized IR data to control motor speeds for accurate line following; implemented a state-machine to handle edges cases",
